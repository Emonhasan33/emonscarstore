		    <p>The Chiron is Bugatti’s natural successor to the Veyron. Powered by a 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine that makes a whopping 1500PS of power and 1600Nm of torque, the Chiron can do the 0-100kmph run in just 2.5 seconds. Power is sent to all four wheels by a Haldex All-Wheel-Drive system and its top speed is limited to 420kmph. The Chiron’s only real competition comes from the Koenigsegg Agera RS and Hennessey Venom GT. Bugatti will build the Chiron in limited numbers, 500 to be precise. Bugatti has now revealed the Chiron Super Sport, which gets the same engine as the modified Super Sport+: a quad-turbo 8.0-litre W16 unit making 1600PS and 1600Nm, paired to a 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch transmission). It takes 2.4 seconds to reach 100kmph from a standstill, 5.8 seconds to 200kmph, and 12.8 seconds to 300kmph. Like the Super Sport 300+, Bugatti has electronically limited its top speed to 440kmph. The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, which is likely to be an ultra exclusive offering, will retail for 3.2 million euros (around Rs 28.40 crore).</p>
